We've all read the "Database vendor gets X,XXX,XXXX writes on this cloud" posts that are popular these days. However, wouldn't it be nice if you could build those types of benchmarks and then run them on the cloud yourself. Turn the knobs, see what changes, and then replicate it on any cloud.

That's what this site is about, we give people the tools and means to grab any set of services and publish the results. Anyone can then take those bits and replicate the tests in multiple clouds.

This site does not endorse or care about individual cloud providers, or which piece of technology performs better than another; all we care about is providing tools and reusable bits of expertise for people to draw their own conclusions. Go get em!
